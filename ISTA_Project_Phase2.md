My nieces Abrianna (8) and Analyssa (6), like most kids, have always had a love for Disney and sweets. They’ve learned how to bake many different things and have watched all Disney movies. Recently, their passion for both struck an idea. Given that they have never been to Disney word, they proposed a business plan to their parents to help fund a trip next summer. They enjoy baking cake pops and proposed a plan to sell their baked goods to neighbors and friends. Advertisement was to be done via Facebook and word of mouth. Little did they know that AkA Cake Pops would scale to be in such a high demand that they can’t keep up. One of their major time consumption and delay is the order process. Furthermore, customers often ask if they can pay via credit cards, can they place an order online or how convenient it would be to place an order via app. 

In order to develop the application, I must understand the requirements from both the seller and the customer. According to the seller, all orders are custom made, but they would like to offer a baseline design for a set price with few options for customization and an option for the buyer to choose more detail designs at a higher cost. The data required from the seller to accomplish this threshold consist of gathering details behind the options a buyer has when ordering a cakepop. The application must contain information about the flavors of batter to be set at the included base price. Frosting colors with a base price included for up to two and option to add more at an extra cost. Drizzle color options with one being the standard and an additional cost for more. A type of sprinkles can also be for an extra cost. Data from the customer includes order identification, first name, last name, street address, city, state and phone number. The information is to be maintained by the seller for future reference and contact. The information must be easily retrieved and understood by the seller in order to coordinate delivery, determine priority, and customer data retrieval. The data is to be sorted by the date and time the order was placed. Credit card payment will be made directly to an account and no credit card information is to be maintained by the seller. 

The user interface for the application is to be interactive with the customer. The customer is to build their customized cake pop in phases and be able to view the design as they move up in phases. The customer is to be allowed to go back and make changes without having to start over. The customer will also have to confirm their design before being prompted to provide their personal information and credit card. As the user opens the application, a quick history behind AkA pops is to be displayed along with pictures of some of the products. Information regarding cake pops is to also be displayed disclosing minimum orders and starting cost. A section displaying links to the business’ Facebook page is to be shown at the beginning of the application and at the last page of the customer’s order completion. The front page of the application is to provide a button inviting the user to begin to design their custom cake pops. First phase of the user selection is to choose the item’s batter, chocolate or vanilla, at no extra cost. This choice initiates the cake pop design and displays the update. The customers will then click “NEXT” on the bottom right hand side and the total displayed at the bottom, middle of the page. Phase two provides frosting choices. Base price includes one choice. $.25 extra per additional choices, max of three. The design updates as the user selects or deselects the choices and an updated total cost is displayed at the bottom, middle of the page. The bottom right side will be click enabled for “NEXT” and the left side click enabled for “BACK”. Customer’s choices are not changed when toggled between pages. Third phase is a choice of drizzle. Base price includes one choice, $.10 extra per additional colors. The design updates as the customers selects or deselect choices and a new total cost is displayed at the bottom, middle of the page. The bottom right side will be click enabled for “NEXT” and the left side click enabled for “BACK”. Fourth phase is a choice of sprinkles. Sprinkles are not included on the base price and it is $.50 extra per choice. The design updates as the customers selects and deselects choices and a new total cost is displayed at the bottom, middle of the page. The bottom right side will be click enabled for “NEXT” and the left side click enabled for “BACK”. Phase four is to display the final design and request the customer’s information: Fname, Lname, phone number, street address, city and state. An active calendar will be display for the customer to choose a desired delivery date, with two weeks’ notice as the minimum choice available for choosing. The total cost is displayed at the bottom, middle of the page. The bottom right side will be click enabled for “NEXT” and the left side click enabled for “BACK.” Phase five is where the customer will pay with a credit card. The page is still displaying the final product and total cost. The bottom right side will be click enabled for “COMPLETE YOUR ORDER” and the left side click enabled for “BACK”. Upon clicking “COMPLETE YOUR ORDER”, a confirmation prompt stating that a “total cost” is to be charged to their credit card. The customer is to click o.k. authorizing the transaction. Phase six will display a thank you page displaying an order number, a link to follow the business on facebook and encouraging the user to provide feedback of their experience via the Facebook page. 
To develop the application using C# in Visual Studio I must use Xamarin as the cross-platform implementation of Common Language Infrastructure, which lets you create applications for iOS and Android. Furthermore, an android emulator must be installed and used in a virtual environment to properly test the application. I need to also create and maintain a SQL server in which the user’s input in the application is stored. The stored data must be able to provide a user-friendly interface that displays order numbers, customer information, order date and requested delivery date, sorted by delivery date. I need to develop the graphic design of the application and of the customized cake pops as they get built. Lastly, I must find a way to enable mobile payments, keeping in mind the security and liability of the transaction. 

Developing this application will require proper project management to ensure its success. While I have gathered some seller and user requirements, I am certain that there will be change requests. To mitigate this, I will need do develop a well-defined scope and a requirement change process. However, I do believe I have enough to begin a detailed system design and the tools to begin the development phase of databases, initial coding and required systems and hardware like Visual Studio, SQLite, Xamarin, Windows 10 Pro, Hyper-V, and a SLAT capable machine. Following development, an integration and testing plan will be developed which will include user integration and acceptance initially on android devices and lastly with iOS. User and seller acceptance will mark the beginning of the implementation phase and provide training to the seller regarding the operation and maintenance of the application. In the event the application is no longer needed, proper disposition instructions will be given to the seller.
