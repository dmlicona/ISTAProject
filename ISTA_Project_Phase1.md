In today’s digitalized world, most of our daily interactions occur online. A decade ago, we could not even imagine the extent to which our lives would be tied up to the web. Many make, spend, and manage money from their computers and mobile devices like never in the past.  Daily lifehacks, how-to videos, health trackers, banking, shopping, and even dating are capabilities only a few clicks away. The term “within your fingertips” is more accurate now than ever before, with mobile devices having to capability to unlock the world wide web by simply reading one’s fingerprint. Such powerful applications are designed with the end user in mind. The following will briefly discuss the workings of three of today’s most popular applications, YouTube, Venmo and Instagram and the capabilities they offer, which makes them a user’s delight. 

Since it first launched in 2005, YouTube has quickly become the number one destination for video content online, attracting over one billion regular users. The Google-owned site gained popularity by enabling people to share their videos with others all over the world, whether it’s an amusing clip of their pet, or footage of them dancing in their living room. In addition, YouTube has also helped people launch careers and one can even earn money directly from YouTube too, as the site shares some of the revenue it makes from companies who pay to run adverts before or over your video. The popularity of YouTube is mainly down to how easy the website is to use. Videos in a range of file formats can be uploaded as YouTube converts it into its Adobe Flash video format, with the file extension .FLV, for you. This enables the video to be played using YouTube’s Flash player, which can be installed on your computer or smart device for free.

Another benefit of YouTube is the ability to embed videos on other websites. By simply copying and pasting a bit of HTML code, you can enable people to watch a video on your own website using the YouTube player. This saves you having to host the video on your site which requires a lot of bandwidth. Bandwidth is the range of signal frequencies needed to transmit data over the internet and you have to pay for the amount you use. YouTube streams vast amounts of data each day, carrying the bandwidth burden for other sites that want to display video.

Although embedding is great for spreading your videos further across the internet, most people will actually find them simply by searching. To help connect users to the videos they are looking for, YouTube uses a complex algorithm made up of over one million lines of code. When you search for a video, the algorithm decides which search results it will show you and in what order. One of the main factors used to rank the results is video metadata. This is the title, description, thumbnail and tags that you give your video when you upload it, so you should make sure they are relevant to the content of the video and what people might search for to find it. However, the other ranking methods YouTube uses are out of your control. The site used to rank its videos by how many times they had been viewed, but this presented a few problems. It often meant that new videos were pushed to the bottom of the list as their view counts had not yet had a chance to grow, and it also enabled people to manipulate their ranking by clicking on their video repeatedly, as clicking the play icon counts as a view.

To combat these problems, YouTube has switched to a new system of measuring a video’s quality by the length of time it has been watched for. If several users have stopped watching after a few seconds, this suggests that the video had a misleading title or thumbnail and didn’t give viewers what they were looking for, whereas if they stayed to watch until the end it was most likely appropriate for the search terms used and therefore worthy of a high ranking. The rest of YouTube’s ranking tricks are a mystery though, as the company is very secretive about its algorithm and changes it all the time to stop people manipulating it.

Every video uploaded to YouTube is stored in at least one of Google’s 14 data centers spread across the world. These enormous buildings contain thousands of servers – the powerful computers that handle the billions of Google searches made every day and also store your videos. Giant cooling towers keep the temperature inside at a steady 27 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) to ensure the equipment runs smoothly, and each piece of data is stored on at least two servers for extra security. The data centers can also communicate with each other to send information between them. When you upload your video, it will be stored at the data center nearest you, but when someone wants to play it, the video will be sent to their nearest data center for quick access. This also means that in the event of a fire or other disaster, the data is sent to another data center so that it’s always accessible. It is YouTube’s way of ensuring high availability. 

In simple terms, a user uploads his/her video. Once uploaded, YouTube copes the video into several different file formats with different levels of video quality. Each version of the video is then chopped up into several different pieces called packets. The packets are then encoded as radio waves which are sent over Wi-Fi or a mobile network. When the signal reaches a cell tower or router, it is transmitted via a wired connection to YouTube’s servers. These servers receive the packets, reassemble them into a video and store it al Google’s data centers. When someone clicks to play the uploaded video, a request is sent over the internet to YouTube’s servers. YouTube selects the best video format based on the browser being used to view it and chops it back into packets. The packets are sent via wired and wireless connections to the viewer’s device. The packets are delivered in order to form the original video at the optimum quality. If the internet connection is slow, the video may buffer when waiting for the next packet to be delivered. 

A popular peer-to-peer payment application available today is Venmo, which works on iOS and Android. It lets you quickly and easily send money to friends and contacts with just a tap. However, the app is also well known for its public (or semi-public) feed of transactions, which resembles a social media feed in some ways. You can like and comment on these transactions, and people often simply use emoji to describe the “reason” (real or fictional) for their payment. Venmo works by linking with your bank account and (optionally) a credit or debit card. Transactions made with either your bank account, debit card, or with your Venmo balance are free, while a standard 3 percent fee is added to credit card transactions. You don’t need to add any money to your Venmo account, but if a friend pays you, you will need to request to withdraw those funds; that money is then typically deposited into your account the next business day. You can use Venmo with contacts, as well as with select businesses. Venmo uses encryption to keep transactions and app data secure.

Users can simply download the app from the App Store or Google Play. After creating an account with an email address or Facebook account, creating a password, and verifying your email address, you’ll link and verify a bank account. The app does this via one of two ways: The first is by you inputting the username and password that you use for online banking. The second is by manually inputting the account number and routing number. When you choose this method, Venmo will send a less than $1 micro-transfer to your bank account along with a simultaneous micro-withdrawal. From there, you can also choose to link a credit or debit card.

After that, you can add friends on Venmo, either searching by name or username, or by granting the app access to your contacts. Alternatively, if you link Venmo to your Facebook account, it can search through your Facebook friends to see who you know on the app. In person, you can also add friends via QR code. To do this, an user simply opens the Venmo code scanner and point it at the QR code pulled up on their phone’s screen. Once scanned, the app will take you to their profile page, where you can add them as a friend. Once you’ve entered your payment information and added friends, you’re ready to go. To make a payment to someone, tap the circular icon in the bottom right of the app. Then, select which friend you want to make a payment with, input the amount, and tap whether you’re requesting money from them or paying them to complete the transaction.

One thing to note: Directly above the Pay button is a button that shows who can see the reason for this transaction in the app’s feed: Public, Friends, or Private. In the latter case, the transaction is completely hidden from the app’s timeline. Otherwise, the description of your transaction, minus the exact dollar amount, will be shared with friends or the public to see. Compared to PayPal, Apple Pay Cash, or other payment apps, Venmo wins on making a traditionally boring chore—paying people—and making it fun. If you’ve got a bit of voyeur in you, scrolling through the app’s transaction feed can be a source of curiosity and entertainment. Deciding how to describe your own transactions is also enjoyable.

Lastly, Instagram is a trendy application that has been around for a few years. It has been quietly picking up traction mostly thanks to everybody's new obsession with mobile photography. Instagram is a social networking app made for sharing photos and videos from a smartphone. Similar to Facebook or Twitter, everyone who creates an Instagram account has a profile and a news feed. When you post a photo or video on Instagram, it will be displayed on your profile. Other users who follow you will see your posts in their own feed. Likewise, you'll see posts from other users whom you choose to follow. It's like a simplified version of Facebook, with an emphasis on mobile use and visual sharing. Just like other social networks, you can interact with other users on Instagram by following them, being followed by them, commenting, liking, tagging and private messaging. You can even save the photos you see on Instagram.

Instagram is available for free on iOS devices, like the iPhone and iPad, as well as Android devices, like phones and tablets from Google, Samsung, etc. It can also be accessed on the web from a computer, but users can only upload and share photos or videos from their devices. Before you can start using the app, Instagram will ask you to create a free account. You can sign up via your existing Facebook account or by email. All you need is a username and a password. You may be asked if you want to follow some friends who are on Instagram in your Facebook network. You can do this right away or skip through the process and come back to it later. Users typically customize their profile by adding their name, a photo, a short bio, and a website link if they have one when they first get on Instagram. When you start following people and looking for people to follow you back, they'll want to know who you are and what you're all about.

Instagram has come a long way since its early days in terms of posting options. When it first launched in 2010, users could only post photos through the app and add filters without any extra editing features. Today, you can post both directly through the app or from existing photos/videos on your device. You can also post both photos and videos up to one full minute in length, and you have a myriad of extra filter options plus the ability to tweak and edit. When you tap the middle Instagram posting tab, you can select the camera or video icon to let the app know whether you want to post a photo or a video. Capture it through the app or tap the photo/video preview box to pull up a previously captured one.

Instagram has up to 23 filters you can choose to apply to both photos and videos. By tapping the Edit option at the bottom of the photo editor, you can also apply editing effects that allow you to edit adjustments, brightness, contrast, and structure. For videos, you can trim them and select a cover frame. If you want to edit your photo or video within the Instagram app, simply tap the wrench icon and choose a feature from the bottom menu. You can adjust the contrast, warmth, saturation, highlights, shadows, vignette, tilt-shift and sharpness.

After you’ve applied an optional filter and possibly made some edits, you’ll be taken to a tab where you can fill out a caption, tag other users to it, tag it to a geographical location and simultaneously post it to some of your other social networks. Once it's published, your followers will be able to view it and interact with it in their feeds. You can always delete your posts or edit their details after you published them by tapping the three dots at the top. You can configure your Instagram account to have photos posted on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or Flickr. If these sharing configurations are all highlighted, as opposed to remaining gray and inactive, then all of your Instagram photos will automatically be posted to your social networks after you press Share. If you don't want your photo shared on any particular social network, simply tap any one of them so that it's gray and set to Off.

It is incredible how easy it has become to share our lives with millions, or simply pay someone back money we owe them without having to walk to an ATM or use a check. Today one can change the oil in a vehicle, build a computer, build a wooden table, even learn a language simply by watching a video found in YouTube. If a user is viewed enough, he/she can even make an income based on the number of viewers they have. Venmo can quickly deal monetary transactions amongst family and friends with a simply click of a button. Instagram keeps it fun by offering a robust list of filters users can use to make their pictures and/or videos more interesting for others to enjoy. All these applications were developed and designed with the end user needs in mind. As computing power increases and ideas flow, applications will become easier, interesting, and more convenient, requiring future software developers to think outside the box.
